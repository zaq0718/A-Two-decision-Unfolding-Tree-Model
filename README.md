# Item Response Theoy Tree Model (IR-tree) and Generalized Graded Unfolding Model(GGUM)
A hybird model is combined with an IR-tree and a GGUM.

Files: 

GGUM-tree.R: using the estimated paramters from the GGUM-tree model to plot the item response surface plot.

ESS_GUMM.R: creating two functions for cleaning data and fitting the GGUM model by using the “GGUM” package in R.

ESS_CZ_Winbugs.R: fitting the GGUM-tree model with Winbugs in an R environment.

Model_CZ_new.txt: the GGUM-tree model for Winbugs.
